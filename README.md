This repository contains materials for the tutorial ["Analysing Physiological Data Collected During Music Listening: An Introduction"](https://ismir2023.ismir.net/tutorials/#1-analysing-physiological-data-collected-during-music-listening-an-introduction) presented at ISMIR 2023 in Milan, Italy.

## Abstract

Music has diverse effects on listeners, including inducing emotions, triggering movement or dancing, and prompting changes in visual attention. These effects are often associated with psychophysiological responses like changes in heart activity, respiratory rate, and pupil size, which can themselves be influenced by the cognitive effort exerted during music listening, e.g., when engaging with unfamiliar tracks on a web radio for music discovery.

This tutorial aims to introduce psychophysiological data analysis for a broad MIR audience, with a particular focus on the analysis of heart rate, electrodermal activity and pupillometry data. It will be structured in three parts. The first part will provide a presentation of psychophysiological data that we collected in the context of a preliminary study related to music discovery. The second part will be a hands-on tutorial during which we will guide the participants to remake two of our data analyses. In the third part, we will assist participants in undertaking their own data analysis of our data. These analyses will be demonstrated using R and Python.

Our aim with this tutorial is twofold: to promote underrepresented topics in the MIR community, especially the recognition of induced emotions from physiological data and discovery-oriented music recommendation; and to encourage researchers from those domains to interact with the MIR community. The audience we target is therefore relatively large. Participants should, however, possess sufficient knowledge of R and/or Python and standard statistical analysis methods to participate in the hands-on parts of the tutorial.

## About the Authors

[**Laura Bishop**](http://lbishop.ca) is a researcher at the RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion and the Department of Musicology at the University of Oslo. She specialises in pupillometry, eye-tracking, and motion capture using approaches mainly grounded in psychology. She completed her PhD in music psychology at the MARCS Institute, Western Sydney University, Australia, in 2013. She currently co-leads the Austrian Science Fund project “Achieving togetherness in music ensembles” in collaboration with the University for Music and Performing Arts Vienna (mdw), which investigates physiological and body motion coordination in ensemble playing.

[**Geoffray Bonnin**](https://members.loria.fr/GBonnin/) is an Associate Professor at the Lorraine Research Laboratory in Computer Science and its Applications (Loria), Université de Lorraine. He obtained his Ph.D. in 2010 and joined the Loria lab in 2014 as an Associate Professor. His research topics are related to artificial intelligence for music and for education. He is currently in charge of the Music-Mouv’ project, which is a collaboration with researchers in the domain of psychology that started in October 2021. The project aims at helping individuals with Parkinson’s disease to walk by triggering relevant emotions through physiology-based music recommendations.

[**Jérémy Frey**](http://phd.jfrey.info) is the CTO and co-founder of Ullo. After a master degree in cognitive sciences, he obtained his PhD degree in computer science in 2015 from the University of Bordeaux, France. During his work within the Inria research team Potioc, he had been studying how passive brain-computer interfaces could contribute to the evaluation of user experience, using for example EEG to infer a continuous index of cognitive load. His current research interests revolve around increasing introspection and social presence, by displaying inner states through tangible interfaces or wearables, with applications ranging from well-being to education.
